# LHC_ATLAS

The aim of this repository is to make an attempt at training machine learning algorithms for classification of electrons and jets (particularly pi0 jets which have a double peak structure).

The trained machine learning models is then compared to the e-ratio algorithm based on their pt dependency and their rejection power.

Models are trained using simulated data which is given by University College London Department of Physics and Astronomy.
