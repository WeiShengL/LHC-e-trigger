# LHC_ATLAS

This was a summer internship project attempting to use machine learning models for classification of electrons and jets (particularly pi0 jets which have a double peak structure in the electromagnetic calorimeter layer).

The aim of this repository is to compare the performance of trained machine learning models to e-ratio algorithm absed on their Pt dependency and their rejection power.

Models are trained using simulated data which is given by University College London Department of Physics and Astronomy.

A brief summary of the project is included in "*summary.docx*"
